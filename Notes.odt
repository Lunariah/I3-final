They called us heroes, every one of us.
They said if we didn’t fight, no one else would do it.
So we kept fighting, throwing everything we had into the void, until there was nothing left of us.
And now they call us traitors.
So we reach for the light, to get back some of what they took from us.
But they keep making more heroes.
